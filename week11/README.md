# COMP2110 Week 11

This week workshop teaches me on how I am being tracked by advertising servers using cookies by Simple Server Application

Server Application 

- At first when installing node.js and implementing it into VS Code. I have encountered some issues with (node -v) command not found
- After help and support from my tutor Salma and classmates, I am able to install node.js and npm. I also helped another peer to troubleshoot the issue with installing nodejs
- Then I access the server to observe how cookies is tracked on my browser by clicking Inspect on the browser
