# COMP2110 Week 12

# Unit Survey
At the beginning of the tutorial class, I spent from around 5-10 minutes taking survey for the Unit and Ms. Khan - tutor for my practical class.

# Password Security

- First I register a username and password. After that there are two value which is password hash and salt.
- I copy the hash and salt value and put it in crack.js.
- Then I run the terminal using command `node crack.js` this command to crack the password. It took 11.750s to crack/
- As the previous default algorithim is slow, we later replace to sha256Hash algorithm.
- I can find that for sha256Hash algorithm, the cracking is much faster.
