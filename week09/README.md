# COMP2110 Week 09

# Task 1

Mobile design usability is as much as important in the way it feels and the way it looks toward end-users. The increasing of mobile users has led industrial design and human factors into consideration for building mobile usability. This requires UX designers to gain more knowledge of how the user physically experiences an app.

How People Use Mobile Devices

Steven Hoober, UX designer has done a research on how user hold and interact with their mobile device. 75% using just their thumb to touch the screen and fewer than 50% holding their phone with only one hand. There are six common ways user hold their phones.
- Cradled
- Hold and Touch
- Two Hands - Landscape
- One Hand - First Order
- One Hand - Second Order
- Two Hands - Portrait

The center of the mobile screen is where mobile users would lay their eyes on when they first look at the screen. It is also the easiest way for them to reach and touch with their thumbs. The users least focus on the mobile edges and corners. While using tablets, users tend to hold the tablets from the sides, with both hands and use thumb to touch the screen.

There is a set of mobile design principles that concepts designers should consider in order to improve mobile usability
    1. Know your users
    2. Understand context
    3. Follow the rule of thumb(s)
    4. Put content first
    5. Stay on (touch) target
    6. Echo the real world with gestures
    7. Use progressive disclosure

By following this general usability principles, mobile designers can adhere to basic ergonomic standards and make the mobile experience comfortable and enjoyable for users, no matter what device they’re using or where they’re using it.

# Task 2

On task 2, I chose Mecca website: https://www.mecca.com/en-au/

to experiment its layout using Chrome and Safari on my personal mobile device.


Responsive vs Adaptive approach
- Responsive approach: not changing the layout when scaling the desktop browsers.

- Adaptive: Has different layout/ design for different devices. 
- How are they displayed with different browser window sizes on different devices? What are the differences?
Do they largely follow a responsive or adaptive design approach?
How many contents can be accessed using just a thumb? Is any other gesture required (refer to the hold and touch gesture figure in The Fundamental Guide to Mobile Usability)? You can use your mobile phone to practise.
Follow up F-shape pattern part in The Fundamental Guide to Mobile Usability, perform an evluation to your targeting pages.
Do they follow the 7 guiding principles for mobile devices in The Fundamental Guide to Mobile Usability? What changes would be needed to achieve an optimal mobile web design? Give your summarization point by point:
Know Your Users
Understand Context of Use
Follow the Rule of Thumb(s)
Put Content First
Stay on (Touch) Target
Echo Real-world Gestures and Movement
Use Progressive Disclosure
