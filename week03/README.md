# COMP2110 Week XX
# Gate N Fences case
1. Bad points
    - redundant detail on the webpage. Too much extra detail.
    - Does not go with the same front and style. Each product has different color and border style such as the 
    - Random floating "Buy Now Visa/ Mastercard" box 
    Good points
    - The footer is concise and it gives customer the store detail and address.
    - All the links of the product does work.
    - 
2.  The site fits together as all the product links do work, except for the search bar. This webpage is for household products: fencing, gate and gardening services.
3. Three question to ask the client:
    - Ask the client if they want to remove extra information such as removing the floating "Visa/Mastercard" and the header.
    - If they want to re-design the webpage such as putting the products into one category and having drop down option on the webpage.
    - If the client wants to fix their products' images.
