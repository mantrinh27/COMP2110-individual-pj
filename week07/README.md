# COMP2110 Week 07

# Task 1 Github Team Workflow and Handling Conflicts
our group work on how to deal with conflicts when committing our work into GIT at the same time.

# Task 2 More Star Wars
Our task today is to continue to work on how to display each of the characters in the film for each character URL in the array.

I made a few typo mistakes such as instead of the curly braces ${this._data.name}
I put round braces and the bug is that it is not showing the characters' names. After debugging with my teammate I'm able to fix it.



/* git config --global.rebase false; */


// just make a change
